# Master Thesis Work Plan: AMOC Early Warning Signals via EOF Analysis
## Next 3 Weeks Implementation Guide

**Thesis Objective:** Encode climate models output into a low-dimensional latent space to identify early warning signals of AMOC tipping points. By reducing the complex climate data to a few hundred key latent variables, the project seeks to detect subtle temporal shifts in this latent space that may indicate an impending AMOC tipping event.

**Approach:** Compress the climate state into a smaller dimension space using EOF analysis. From this smaller space, reconstruct AMOC values similar to those obtained with full climate state (before compression). Then identify patterns in the smaller latent space to explain when/how the AMOC slows down.

**Current Status:** 
- ✅ EOF analysis completed on SST, SSS, and MLD for one ensemble member in one model
- Variables: Temperature and Salinity (SST, SSS initially; 3D later)
- Time period: 1840-2014

**Available Data:** 
- CMIP6 model data (multiple ensemble members available)
- Observational data: EN4, etc.
- All standard ocean variables including 3D temperature and salinity

## Week 1: Multi-Member EOF Analysis & Ensemble Mean

### Day 1-2: Expand EOF Analysis to Multiple Ensemble Members

**Goal:** Perform EOF analysis on multiple ensemble members of the same model

**Steps:**

1. **Select your model and members:**
   ```python
   # Example: if using CESM2
   model = 'CESM2'
   members = ['r1i1p1f1', 'r2i1p1f1', 'r3i1p1f1', 'r4i1p1f1', 'r5i1p1f1']
   # Aim for at least 5 members, ideally 10 if available
   ```

2. **Load data for each member (1840-2014):**
   - SST (`tos`)
   - SSS (`sos`)
   - MLD (`mlotst` or `mld`)

3. **Perform EOF analysis on each member separately:**
   ```python
   for member in members:
       # Load data
       SST = load_data(model, member, 'tos', years='1840-2014')
       
       # Remove climatology (seasonal cycle)
       SST_anom = SST - SST.groupby('time.month').mean('time')
       
       # Perform EOF
       eof_patterns[member], pcs[member], explained_var[member] = calculate_eof(SST_anom, n_modes=10)
       
       # Save results
       save_eof_results(member, eof_patterns[member], pcs[member])
   ```

4. **Repeat for SSS and MLD**

5. **Document:**
   - Number of members analyzed
   - Time period for each member
   - Any missing data or issues

**Quality Checks:**
- Do all members have complete data (1840-2014)?
- Are EOF patterns physically reasonable?
- Check explained variance: does EOF1 explain >20% for SST?

**Deliverable:** 
- EOF patterns and PCs for all members
- Table: Member | EOF1_variance | EOF2_variance | EOF3_variance (for each variable)

---

### Day 3-4: Compare Leading Modes Across Members

**Goal:** Compare the first 3 EOF modes across all ensemble members

**Steps:**

1. **Visualize EOF spatial patterns for each member:**
   ```python
   # For SST, plot EOF modes 1-3 for all members
   fig, axes = plt.subplots(n_members, 3, figsize=(15, 4*n_members))
   
   for i, member in enumerate(members):
       for mode in [0, 1, 2]:  # EOF 1, 2, 3
           plot_eof_pattern(eof_patterns[member][mode], ax=axes[i, mode])
           axes[i, mode].set_title(f'{member} - EOF{mode+1}')
   ```

2. **Compare spatial patterns:**
   - Are EOF1 patterns similar across members?
   - Do they capture the same physical features?
   - Calculate pattern correlation between members:
     ```python
     pattern_corr = correlate_2d_fields(EOF1_member1, EOF1_member2)
     ```

3. **Compare principal components (time series):**
   ```python
   # Plot PC1 for all members on same plot
   plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
   for member in members:
       plt.plot(time, pcs[member][0], label=member, alpha=0.7)
   plt.legend()
   plt.title('PC1 comparison across members')
   ```

4. **Calculate correlation between PC time series:**
   ```python
   # Correlation matrix of PC1 across all members
   pc1_correlations = calculate_pc_correlation_matrix(pcs, mode=0)
   # Plot as heatmap
   ```

5. **Analyze explained variance consistency:**
   - Plot bar chart: explained variance for EOF 1-3 across members
   - Calculate mean and standard deviation

6. **Repeat for EOF modes 2 and 3**

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- Are EOF patterns consistent across ensemble members?
- Which modes are most stable across members?
- Is internal variability affecting lower-order modes?

**Deliverable:**
- Spatial pattern comparison plots (3 panels × N members)
- PC time series comparison plots
- Correlation matrix (members vs members) for each EOF mode
- Summary table of pattern correlations

---

### Day 5-7: Calculate Ensemble Mean EOF

**Goal:** Create an ensemble mean of the first EOF across all members

**Steps:**

1. **Align EOF signs across members:**
   ```python
   # EOFs can have arbitrary sign. Need to align them.
   # Use reference member (e.g., first member)
   reference_eof = eof_patterns[members[0]][0]
   
   for member in members[1:]:
       # Calculate spatial correlation
       corr = correlate_2d_fields(reference_eof, eof_patterns[member][0])
       
       # If negative correlation, flip sign
       if corr < 0:
           eof_patterns[member][0] *= -1
           pcs[member][0] *= -1
   ```

2. **Calculate ensemble mean EOF pattern:**
   ```python
   # For EOF mode 1
   eof_ensemble_mean = np.mean([eof_patterns[m][0] for m in members], axis=0)
   
   # Calculate uncertainty (standard deviation)
   eof_ensemble_std = np.std([eof_patterns[m][0] for m in members], axis=0)
   ```

3. **Calculate ensemble mean PC:**
   ```python
   # Two approaches:
   
   # Approach A: Average PCs
   pc_ensemble_mean = np.mean([pcs[m][0] for m in members], axis=0)
   
   # Approach B: Project data onto ensemble mean EOF
   # (more robust if patterns differ slightly)
   for member in members:
       SST_anom = load_normalized_data(member)
       pc_projected[member] = project_onto_eof(SST_anom, eof_ensemble_mean)
   pc_ensemble_mean = np.mean([pc_projected[m] for m in members], axis=0)
   ```

4. **Visualize ensemble mean:**
   ```python
   fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 5))
   
   # Panel 1: Ensemble mean EOF pattern
   plot_map(eof_ensemble_mean, ax=axes[0], title='Ensemble Mean EOF1')
   
   # Panel 2: Uncertainty (std)
   plot_map(eof_ensemble_std, ax=axes[1], title='EOF1 Std Across Members')
   ```

5. **Repeat for EOF modes 2 and 3**

6. **Create ensemble mean for SSS and MLD as well**

**Statistical Analysis:**
- Calculate signal-to-noise ratio: mean/std
- Identify regions of high agreement vs. high uncertainty

**Deliverable:**
- Ensemble mean EOF patterns (modes 1-3) for SST, SSS, MLD
- Ensemble mean PCs (time series)
- Uncertainty maps (standard deviation across members)
- Signal-to-noise ratio maps

## Week 2: Member Anomalies & Temporal Analysis

### Day 8-9: Calculate and Plot Member Anomalies

**Goal:** Create plots showing each member minus the ensemble mean

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate anomalies from ensemble mean (EOF patterns):**
   ```python
   for member in members:
       # For EOF mode 1
       eof_anomaly[member] = eof_patterns[member][0] - eof_ensemble_mean
       
       # Calculate RMSE
       rmse[member] = np.sqrt(np.mean(eof_anomaly[member]**2))
   ```

2. **Create comprehensive comparison figure:**
   ```python
   # Figure with N rows (one per member) and 3 columns
   # Column 1: Individual member EOF1
   # Column 2: Ensemble mean EOF1 (repeated)
   # Column 3: Difference (member - mean)
   
   fig, axes = plt.subplots(n_members, 3, figsize=(15, 4*n_members))
   
   for i, member in enumerate(members):
       plot_map(eof_patterns[member][0], ax=axes[i,0], 
                title=f'{member} EOF1')
       plot_map(eof_ensemble_mean, ax=axes[i,1], 
                title='Ensemble Mean EOF1')
       plot_map(eof_anomaly[member], ax=axes[i,2], 
                title=f'{member} - Mean')
   ```

3. **Statistical summary of anomalies:**
   ```python
   # Create box plots
   fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
   data = [eof_anomaly[m].flatten() for m in members]
   ax.boxplot(data, labels=members)
   ax.set_ylabel('EOF1 Anomaly')
   ax.set_title('Distribution of EOF Pattern Anomalies')
   ```

4. **Repeat for PC anomalies:**
   ```python
   for member in members:
       pc_anomaly[member] = pcs[member][0] - pc_ensemble_mean
       
   # Plot all PC anomalies
   plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
   for member in members:
       plt.plot(time, pc_anomaly[member], label=member, alpha=0.7)
   plt.axhline(0, color='k', linestyle='--')
   plt.legend()
   plt.title('PC1 Anomalies from Ensemble Mean')
   ```

5. **Quantify inter-member spread:**
   - Calculate correlation between each member and ensemble mean
   - Identify outlier members (if any)
   - Calculate temporal evolution of spread (is it constant or changing?)

**Key Insights to Extract:**
- Which members deviate most from ensemble mean?
- Are deviations systematic or random?
- Do deviations have spatial patterns?
- How does inter-member spread change over time?

**Deliverable:**
- Multi-panel comparison figures (member vs mean)
- Anomaly distribution plots
- PC anomaly time series
- Table: Member | Pattern_Correlation | RMSE | Explained_Variance

---

### Day 10-12: Lagged Correlation Analysis

**Goal:** Investigate temporal relationships and potential predictability

**Steps:**

1. **Load AMOC data for your model:**
   ```python
   # For each member
   for member in members:
       AMOC[member] = load_amoc_data(model, member, years='1840-2014')
       # Calculate annual mean if monthly
       AMOC_annual[member] = AMOC[member].groupby('time.year').mean()
   ```

2. **Calculate lagged correlations between PCs and AMOC:**
   ```python
   lags = np.arange(-20, 21)  # -20 to +20 years
   
   for member in members:
       for mode in [0, 1, 2]:  # EOF 1, 2, 3
           for lag in lags:
               corr = lagged_correlation(pcs[member][mode], 
                                        AMOC_annual[member], 
                                        lag=lag)
               lagged_corr[member][mode][lag] = corr
   
   # Plot lagged correlation
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   for member in members:
       plt.plot(lags, lagged_corr[member][0], label=member)
   plt.axhline(0, color='k', linestyle='--')
   plt.xlabel('Lag (years)')
   plt.ylabel('Correlation')
   plt.title('PC1-AMOC Lagged Correlation')
   plt.legend()
   ```

3. **Ensemble mean lagged correlation:**
   ```python
   lagged_corr_ensemble = np.mean([lagged_corr[m][0] for m in members], axis=0)
   lagged_corr_std = np.std([lagged_corr[m][0] for m in members], axis=0)
   
   # Plot with uncertainty
   plt.fill_between(lags, 
                    lagged_corr_ensemble - lagged_corr_std,
                    lagged_corr_ensemble + lagged_corr_std,
                    alpha=0.3)
   plt.plot(lags, lagged_corr_ensemble, linewidth=2)
   ```

4. **Cross-correlation between PC modes:**
   ```python
   # Do PC1 and PC2 have temporal relationships?
   for member in members:
       cross_corr = lagged_correlation(pcs[member][0], pcs[member][1], lags)
   ```

5. **Identify optimal lag times:**
   - At what lag is correlation maximum?
   - Is there predictability (positive lag correlation)?
   - Are there precursor signals?

6. **Test for autocorrelation in PCs:**
   ```python
   # Calculate AR(1) coefficient
   for member in members:
       ar1[member] = calculate_ar1(pcs[member][0])
   
   # Increasing AR(1) could indicate critical slowing down
   # Plot AR(1) in sliding windows
   window = 30  # years
   ar1_timeseries = sliding_window_ar1(pcs[member][0], window)
   ```

**Advanced Analysis (if time permits):**

## Week 3: Comparison with Observations & Planning 3D Extension

### Day 15-17: Compare with Observed Data (EN4)

**Goal:** Validate model EOF patterns against observations

**Steps:**

1. **Load and prepare observational data:**
   ```python
   # EN4 dataset
   obs_sst = load_EN4_data('temperature', depth='surface', years='1840-2014')
   obs_sss = load_EN4_data('salinity', depth='surface', years='1840-2014')
   
   # Note: EN4 may not go back to 1840, typically starts ~1900
   # Adjust time period to overlap: e.g., 1950-2014
   overlap_period = '1950-2014'
   ```

2. **Regrid if necessary:**
   ```python
   # Ensure obs and model are on same grid
   obs_sst_regridded = regrid_to_model_grid(obs_sst, model_grid)
   ```

3. **Perform EOF analysis on observations:**
   ```python
   # Same procedure as for model
   obs_sst_anom = obs_sst - obs_sst.groupby('time.month').mean('time')
   obs_eof_patterns, obs_pcs, obs_explained_var = calculate_eof(obs_sst_anom, n_modes=10)
   ```

4. **Compare EOF patterns: Model vs Observations:**
   ```python
   # For EOF mode 1
   pattern_corr = correlate_2d_fields(eof_ensemble_mean, obs_eof_patterns[0])
   
   # Create comparison figure
   fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))
   plot_map(eof_ensemble_mean, ax=axes[0], title='Model Ensemble Mean EOF1')
   plot_map(obs_eof_patterns[0], ax=axes[1], title='Observed EOF1')
   plot_map(eof_ensemble_mean - obs_eof_patterns[0], ax=axes[2], 
            title='Difference')
   
   axes[0].text(0.05, 0.95, f'Corr: {pattern_corr:.2f}', 
                transform=axes[0].transAxes)
   ```

5. **Compare PC time series:**
   ```python
   # Normalize both PCs for comparison
   model_pc1_norm = normalize(pc_ensemble_mean)
   obs_pc1_norm = normalize(obs_pcs[0])
   
   plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
   plt.plot(time, model_pc1_norm, label='Model Ensemble Mean', linewidth=2)
   plt.plot(time, obs_pc1_norm, label='Observations (EN4)', linewidth=2)
   plt.legend()
   plt.title('PC1 Comparison: Model vs Observations')
   
   # Calculate correlation

### Day 18-19: Plan 3D Extension

**Goal:** Design strategy for extending EOF analysis to 3D ocean fields

**Steps:**

1. **Review data requirements:**
   ```python
   # 3D temperature and salinity
   # Variables: thetao (3D potential temperature), so (3D salinity)
   
   # Consider data volume:
   # - Spatial dimensions: lat × lon × depth
   # - Temporal: 1840-2014 (175 years)
   # - Multiple members
   # This is LARGE data!
   ```

2. **Design 3D EOF approach:**

   **Option A: Depth-integrated EOFs**
   ```python
   # Integrate over specific depth ranges
   temp_0_300m = vertical_integral(temp_3d, depth_range=[0, 300])
   temp_300_1000m = vertical_integral(temp_3d, depth_range=[300, 1000])
   # Then perform EOF on integrated fields
   ```

   **Option B: Depth-level EOFs**
   ```python
   # Perform EOF separately at key depth levels
   depths_of_interest = [0, 100, 300, 500, 1000, 2000]
   for depth in depths_of_interest:
       eof_at_depth = calculate_eof(temp_3d.sel(depth=depth))
   ```

   **Option C: Full 3D EOF**
   ```python
   # Reshape 3D data to 2D: (time, space×depth)
   temp_reshaped = temp_3d.reshape(time, lat*lon*depth)
   # Perform EOF on reshaped data
   # Patterns will be 3D structures
   ```

   **Option D: Vertical modes first, then horizontal**
   ```python
   # First decompose vertically (at each horizontal point)
   # Then perform horizontal EOF on vertical mode amplitudes
   # More physically interpretable
   ```

3. **Assess computational feasibility:**
   - Estimate memory requirements
   - Test with single member first
   - Consider downsampling strategies:
     * Spatial coarsening
     * Temporal subsampling (e.g., annual means only)
     * Depth level selection

4. **Select focus region:**
   ```python
   # To reduce data volume, focus on AMOC-relevant region
   # North Atlantic: 80°W-0°W, 0°N-70°N
   temp_3d_atlantic = temp_3d.sel(lon=slice(-80, 0), lat=slice(0, 70))
   ```

5. **Create test implementation:**
   ```python
   # Simple test with one member, one year
   test_data = load_3d_data(model, member='r1i1p1f1', year=2000)
   
   # Try each approach and time it
   import time
   start = time.time()
   eof_3d = calculate_3d_eof(test_data)
   elapsed = time.time() - start
   print(f"3D EOF took {elapsed:.1f} seconds")
   ```

6. **Design analysis pipeline:**
   ```
   1. Load 3D data (by chunks if needed)
   2. Preprocess (remove climatology, detrend if needed)
   3. Apply EOF method (chosen from options above)
   4. Validate reconstruction quality
   5. Relate to AMOC
   6. Compare across members
   ```

7. **Identify challenges and solutions:**
   ```
   Challenge 1: Data volume too large
   → Solution: Use dask for lazy loading, process in chunks
   
   Challenge 2: EOF computation slow
   → Solution: Use randomized SVD for large matrices
   
   Challenge 3: Interpretation of 3D patterns
   → Solution: Create cross-sections and vertical profiles
   ```

**Deliverable:**
- Document outlining 3D EOF strategy
- Pros/cons of each approach
- Test results with single member
- Computational requirements estimate
- Recommended approach with justification
- Timeline for 3D implementation (Week 4+)

### Day 20-21: Explore Neural Network Approach

**Goal:** Investigate using neural networks to learn the latent space

**Steps:**

1. **Research autoencoder architectures for climate data:**
   - Convolutional autoencoders for spatial data
   - Variational autoencoders (VAE) for uncertainty quantification
   - Recent papers using neural networks for climate EOF-like analysis

2. **Design basic autoencoder architecture:**
   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf
   from tensorflow import keras
   
   # Simple autoencoder for SST fields
   input_shape = (lat_dim, lon_dim)
   latent_dim = 10  # Compare to 10 EOF modes
   
   # Encoder
   encoder = keras.Sequential([
       keras.layers.Input(shape=input_shape),
       keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu', padding='same'),
       keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2),
       keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu', padding='same'),
       keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2),
       keras.layers.Flatten(),
       keras.layers.Dense(latent_dim)  # Latent space
   ])
   
   # Decoder
   decoder = keras.Sequential([
       keras.layers.Input(shape=(latent_dim,)),
       keras.layers.Dense(reduced_spatial_dim),
       keras.layers.Reshape((reduced_lat, reduced_lon, 64)),
       keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose(64, 3, activation='relu', padding='same'),
       keras.layers.UpSampling2D(2),
       keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose(32, 3, activation='relu', padding='same'),
       keras.layers.UpSampling2D(2),
       keras.layers.Conv2D(1, 3, activation='linear', padding='same')
   ])
   
   autoencoder = keras.Model(inputs=encoder.input, 
                            outputs=decoder(encoder.output))
   ```

3. **Prepare training data:**
   ```python
   # Use your model ensemble data
   # Split: 80% training, 20% validation
   
   X_train = []
   for member in members:
       SST_anom = load_normalized_data(member, 'SST', years='1840-2000')
       X_train.append(SST_anom)
   X_train = np.concatenate(X_train)
   
   X_val = [load for years 2000-2014]
   ```

4. **Train autoencoder:**
   ```python
   autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
   history = autoencoder.fit(X_train, X_train,  # Reconstruct input
                            validation_data=(X_val, X_val),
                            epochs=100,
                            batch_size=32)
   ```

5. **Compare with EOF results:**
   ```python
   # Reconstruction quality
   sst_reconstructed_ae = autoencoder.predict(X_test)
   sst_reconstructed_eof = reconstruct_from_eof(X_test, eof_patterns, n_modes=10)
   
   # Compare RMSE
   rmse_ae = np.sqrt(np.mean((X_test - sst_reconstructed_ae)**2))
   rmse_eof = np.sqrt(np.mean((X_test - sst_reconstructed_eof)**2))
   
   print(f"Autoencoder RMSE: {rmse_ae:.4f}")
   print(f"EOF RMSE: {rmse_eof:.4f}")
   ```

6. **Analyze learned latent space:**
   ```python
   # Extract latent representations
   latent_representations = encoder.predict(X_train)
   
   # Do they correlate with AMOC?
   for i in range(latent_dim):
       corr = correlate(latent_representations[:, i], AMOC)
       print(f"Latent dimension {i} - AMOC correlation: {corr:.3f}")
   ```

7. **Compare latent space: Neural network vs EOF:**
   - Are neural network latent variables similar to PCs?
   - Does neural network capture nonlinear relationships?
   - Is reconstruction better with same dimensionality?

8. **Document findings and next steps:**
   - Advantages of neural network approach
   - Computational requirements
   - Interpretability vs performance trade-off
   - Recommendations for full implementation

**Literature to Review:**
- Ham et al. (2019) - Deep learning for ENSO prediction
- Sonnewald et al. (2021) - Unsupervised learning for ocean dynamics
- Toms et al. (2020) - ML for climate extremes
- Kadow et al. (2020) - Artificial intelligence reconstructs missing climate information

**Deliverable:**
- Literature review summary (1-2 pages)
- Basic autoencoder implementation and results
- Comparison: EOF vs Neural Network (table with metrics)
- Recommendations for which approach to pursue
- Timeline for full neural network implementation

## Practical Implementation Tips

### Managing Multiple Members

```python
# Efficient data management
import xarray as xr
import dask

# Load multiple members at once
ds_all_members = xr.open_mfdataset(
    f'{data_path}/tos_{model}_r*i1p1f1_*.nc',
    combine='nested',
    concat_dim='member',
    parallel=True,
    chunks={'time': 120}  # Chunk for efficient processing
)
```

### Saving Results Systematically

```python
# Organize output directory
output_structure = """

├── eof_patterns/
│   ├── sst/
│   │   ├── r1i1p1f1_eof_patterns.nc
